# Algorithms

* Project 1 is a completed set of phone dictionary functionalities based on user input data and provides Sorting, Searching, Insertion, Updation and Deletion. All these operations are done by optimized algorithms without using the standard library functions for doing so.
* Project 2
  * Floyd matrix to calculate shortest path between all nodes using Dynamic Programming
  * Optimal Binary Seach Tree using recursion and probability theory
  * Tromino tiles in a grid using recursion
* Project 3
  * 0/1 Knapsack problem solution with BruteForce, Backtracking and Dynamic Programming
  * Huffman encoding using binary tree
